PROJECT TITLE: WordDestroyer!

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: I found that I was wasting far too much time playing the
  game Wordscapes (found here in the app store: 
  https://apps.apple.com/cg/app/wordscapes/id1207472156), so I created this 
  program to help me beat the game quickly.
 
VERSION or DATE: Winter 2018

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: java WordDestroyer

AUTHORS: Jeromey Klein

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Enter in the letter presented to you on a giver level of
  Wordscapes. WordDestroyer will then generate all of the possible letter
  combinations and use a dictionary to find all of the possible words. 
  
  Once you have already entered in a few words, navigate the list by entering in
  specific crossword positions you need to fill. For example if you have the 
  configuration "c m " in the app, you can precisely enter "c m " and
  WordDestroyer! might narrow down the list to "came" and "come". If all you know
  is that a word must have four letters, simply enter in four spaces "    " and
  WordDestroyer! will print all four letter words.
  
  Enter in a new combination of letters (no spaces) to generate a new list of
  words for the next level of Wordscapes and watch as you slowly but surely climb
  the ranks and beat the entire game!
